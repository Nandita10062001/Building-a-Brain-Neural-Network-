<h1>Building a Brain (Simple Neural Network)</h1>
Neurons are the fundamental building blocks to a neural network. Just like how biological neurons send an electrical impulse under specific stimuli, artificial neural networks similarly result in a numerical output with a given numerical input.

We can break down building a neuron into 3 steps:
- Defining the architecture
- Intiating training
- Evaluating the model
